EZ Order Clone

EZ Order Clone is a lightweight and intuitive plugin designed to fill the gap left by WooCommerce’s lack of a native order duplication feature. By providing a simple, one-click solution, it empowers store administrators to effortlessly clone any existing order and set the new copy’s status to "Pending payment," making it easier to recreate orders without manual data entry.

Key Features:

One-Click Cloning: Duplicate existing orders directly from the order management screen.
Consistent Data Handling: Carry over products, billing, and shipping details into the cloned order.
Time-Saving: Eliminate the need to re-enter order details from scratch.
Pending Payment Status: Automatically mark new orders as "Pending payment" for streamlined follow-up or further modifications.
Who Should Use This Plugin?
Store owners, shop managers, and developers managing WooCommerce stores who need a quick, reliable way to recreate orders—particularly useful for testing, handling custom requests, or streamlining internal workflows.
