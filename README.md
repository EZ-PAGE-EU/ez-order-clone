# EZ Order Clone

**EZ Order Clone** is a lightweight and intuitive plugin designed to fill the gap left by WooCommerce’s lack of a native order duplication feature.

- **Consistent Data Handling:** Carry over products, billing, and shipping details into the cloned order.
- **Time-Saving:** Eliminate the need to re-enter order details from scratch.
- **Pending Payment Status:** Automatically mark new orders as "Pending payment" for streamlined follow-up or further modifications.

## Who Should Use This Plugin?

**EZ Order Clone** is ideal for:
- Store owners and shop managers who frequently need to recreate or test orders.
- Developers managing WooCommerce stores, especially when handling custom requests or streamlining internal workflows.
